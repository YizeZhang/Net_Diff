# Net_Diff

Net_Diff is a software for GNSS Download, Positioning and Analysis.

It enables users to perform SPP/PPP/PPP-AR/DSPP/DPPP/RTK/PPP-RTK. All the signals of the current GPS/GLONASS/BeiDou/Galileo/QZSS/IRNSS are supported from single-frequency to triple-frequency. It can also be applied in SPP/PPP with BeiDou augmentation information (authorized user).

It supports data analysis, including coordinate plotting, coordinate comparison, satellite number, PDOP, satellite skyview, satellite visibility, cycleslip, troposphere, ionosphere, observation minus correction, positioning residuals plotting and KML file writing.
 
It provides GNS observation data and products download from many public FTP servers.

It also provides some useful tools such as time and coordinate system transferring, RTCM data receiving through Ntrip and TCP/IP, raw data converting, RINEX editing, ssr dumping, CLALIB and so on.

It provides a simple satellite orbit simulation.

Moreover, it supports multi-station PPP, clock estimation, DCB estimation based on GNSS net (authorized user).

If you have problem in downloading Net_Diff, it is probably due to the Great Fire Wall (https://sardingfish.top/2020/04/11/GithubDownload/). In this case, you can turn to here for downloading: http://center.shao.ac.cn/shao_gnss_ac/


We also provide online PPP/RTK Service:

## How to install:
 1. Install gzip
   
        Click gzip-1.3.12-1-setup.exe and install gzip. 
      
        For example, after install it, gzip.exe is under C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\
  
 2. Install Net_Diff
 
    *a) If you have installed MATLAB R2017a or MATLAB Runtime version 9.2 (R2017a) on your computer.*
   
        Open /for_redistribution_files_only/ and click Net_Diff.exe
      
    *b) If not.*
   
        Open /for_redistribution/ and click Net_Diff_Installer_web.exe to install MATLAB Runtime and Net_Diff.exe
     
        Please keep your computer connected to internet while installing.
        
        It will take a few minutes to download MATLAB Runtime, please be patient.
        
        If error occurs in connecting MathWorks, try to rerun the installer, or check the firewall, proxy server or virus scanner settings.
        
        If error occurs in downloading MATLAB Runtime 9.2, please download or update it by hand from:        
        https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
        
        After installation, you can find the execute file from the installed program directory, for example C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\. 
      
  3. Set environment variables
  
         This step is to automatically unzip the downloaded file and convert the crx file to rinex file if you want to download or update files in Net_Diff. 
         
         To do this, please add the path of gzip.exe (C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\) and crx2rnx.exe (C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\) to the PATH of system environment variables on your computer:
    
         My computer-->Properties-->Advanced system setting-->Environment variables-->Edit the PATH environment variable-->Add path
    
         If you have problems in setting the environment variables, you can simply copy C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\gzip.exe to C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application and run Net_Diff from C:\Net_Diff\ application. 
         When running Net_Diff from the Windows Start or the Desktop, you should also copy C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\gzip.exe and C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\crx2rnx.exe to the folder of C:\Windows\System32 or Desktop.

## Tips:

* 1. If you run Net_Diff from the Windows Start or Desktop, please select the correct directory of the EOP file, Ant File and GLO&Leap file in the Input folder (C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\Input) every time. Therefore, it is recommended to run Net_Diff from the execute file (You can also copy the folder of C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application to any other directories).

* 2. If the directory of Net_Diff.exe is not allowed to write files, try to run Net_Diff.exe from the administrator.

* 3. When updating Net_Diff, you only need to copy the updated files in for_redistribution_files_only/ to C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\. The updated files can also be found under the "release" tag.

* 4. As for the use of Net_Diff, please refer to the help document *"A guide to use Net_Diff.pdf"*.

* 5. The document *"A Comparison of Net_Diff and RTKLIB.pdf"* compares the performance of Net_Diff and RTKLIB for a better understanding of Net_Diff.
